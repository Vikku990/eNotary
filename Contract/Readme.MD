# eNotary

## 🏛️ Project Description
**eNotary** is a blockchain-based decentralized notary system that allows users to register and verify document authenticity using document hashes.  
By leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, eNotary ensures tamper-proof document verification without relying on a central authority.

---

## 🌍 Project Vision
To create a transparent, secure, and immutable record-keeping system for legal documents, certificates, and agreements — ensuring trust and authenticity in the digital age.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Document Registration:** Users can upload and register document hashes on-chain with timestamps.  
- **Verification:** Anyone can verify whether a document hash is registered and authentic.  
- **Immutable Records:** Once registered, document data cannot be altered or deleted.  
- **Transparency:** All actions are publicly viewable on the blockchain.  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with IPFS for decentralized document storage.  
- Role-based access control for government or institutional notaries.  
- Web3 frontend for easy user interaction.  
- Support for multi-signature document verification.  
- Implementation of off-chain metadata indexing for improved performance.
